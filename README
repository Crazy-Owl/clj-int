Clj-int - clojure bindings for swing.

This is still some stuff to play around, hope i'll be able to update it.

How-to:

1) go to src/ directory
2) start clojure repl, make sure that clj-int/widgets.clj is visible from classpath
3) in a repl, enter
   (use 'clj-int.widgets)
   (test-frame)
4) a frame with label and button should appear
